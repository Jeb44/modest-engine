# modest-engine

A small game engine to study game architecture. The game engine is designed around the idea of 3d strategy games, like "Sid Meier's Civlization", "Age of Wonders" or "Parkitect".

This uses Jason Gregory's "Game Engine Architecture" book as foundation and red thread.
And makes excensive use of Robert Nystorm's "Game Programming Patterns".
