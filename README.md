# modest-engine

A small game engine to study game architecture. The game engine is designed around the idea of 3d strategy games, like "Sid Meier's Civlization" or "Parkitect".

This uses Jason Gregory's "Game Engine Architecture" book as foundation and  red thread.
And makes excensive use of Robert Nystorm's "Game Programming Patterns".
